<p>Three huge tree branches fell on my car over 3 weeks ago and initially the property manager accepted negligence and assured me that they would pay for all damages and there was not need to worry We are going to take care of you. It completely covered my car and I was unable to move it so I called the emergency line for my rental company and they sent someone over. Tree fell on my car. Here you have to be ready to prove that the tree was in a weakened condition for some reason such as age disease or a bad root system and the neighbor knew about it but was negligent in failing to do something about it. To proceed with the legal process you will have to file a claim with the government.

<p>I was walking my dog through an apartment complex and a tree fell on me. However due to premises liability your insurance carrier may deny your claim. I had to go to the emergency room and I dont think I should have to pay for it. When we came back there was a giant tree branch that snapped and landed on my car caving in the roof and denting it all over the place. I and about everyone else I talk to says his homeowners insurance should cover it. Pin By Ragnheidur On Sunny Architecture Beautiful Places Future House.</p>
