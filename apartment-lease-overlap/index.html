<p>Ideally you can move in early or out late. Especially if your rental home is in a college town or in areas where there are a lot of young professionals renting a single-family home to multiple roommates might be. That way you can use what youd usually spend on rent to cover the first month on the new place plus last and deposit and you have a month of overlap. The usual arrangement that I have seen when moving in the same area is to overlap the apartments by a few days. You have the right to possession of the unit from the day the lease begins to the day that the lease ends.

<p>We rent near DFW airport. But in some locations it might make more sense to offer multiple tenant leases for a single-family property. My daughter who is over 18 years old signed a lease at college and was unaware that it had a 3 month overlap with another lease. If its not managed correctly it can mean having two sets of direct debits going out for the same service. With overlapping leases you do not have as much of a strict deadline over your head when it comes to making sure you are completely moved out of an apartment.
