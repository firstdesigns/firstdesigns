For example if the apartment you want to buy costs 200000 you can expect a 7000 payment for a 35 FHA down payment. We use mortgage loan limits down to the county level to identify if a user qualifies for an FHA or Conforming loan. The typical down payment on a mortgaged home in 2019 was 10-19 of the purchase price of the home. We have built local datasets so we can calculate exactly what closing costs will.
