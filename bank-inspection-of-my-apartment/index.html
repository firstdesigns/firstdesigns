<p>Only schedule inspections during normal business hours from 8 am. This can help avert or minimize disputes with your landlord in the future about the condition of the property as well as providing you with a safer more pleasant place to live according to Justia. An apartment inspection should take place before you sign your lease. Where it is a bank inspection normally the inspection would be carried out between 9am and 5pm and the landlord is within his or her rights to ask that you make the unit available during those hours. Worst case is that the landlord is trying to sell the building. 10 Things To Do Before Buying A Home Homebuyingtips Financetips Budgeting An Immersive Guide By Danielle Kim Home Buying Tips.</p>
