            <p>Well then how is the twist-boat conformation possibly stable. This is for two reasons. chair boat conformation more stable.</p>
<p><strong>Chair Boat Conformation More Stable</strong>, A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane.</p>

<p>A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. The boat conformation is less stable than the chair form for two major reasons. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation.</p>
<h3 id="the-boat-conformation-has-unfavorable-steric-interactions-between-a-pair-of-14-hydrogens-the-so-called-flagpole-hydrogens-that-are">The boat conformation has unfavorable steric interactions between a pair of 14 hydrogens the so-called flagpole hydrogens that are.</h3><p>A dihedral angle is one where there are four atoms connected together and under consideration. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. The strain in the boat-conformation can be minimised somewhat by twisting it. This is for two reasons. The chair conformation allows it to have the closest possible angle which would be 1109 degreesDue to this the strain reduces and results in a lowered energy.</p>

<p>Ring its as far as possible from this ch2 as possible so in that situation we have a lower potential energy or it is a more stable more stable shape or more stable configuration in the both configuration this ch2 up here is much closer to this ch2 I mean thats. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. The answer is because of the torsional and steric strains which are more present in a boat conformation. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. Among which chair conformation is most stable because it has negligible ring strains so its potential energy is 0 kcalmol.

Up to now we have not described in detail the rotational path of cyclohexane and what is the end result. In both conformations chair and boat the bond angle is 1095 which eliminates the angular strain in the cyclohexane structure. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. The chair conformation is the most stable due to the following reasons. Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Introduction And Mechanism Organic Chemistry Study Chemistry Lessons Organic Chemistry.</p>

<p>Alright so as you have noticed by now the chair conformation has a lower energy and is therefore more stable than the twist-boat conformation. The boat conformation is quite flexible. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. Therefore the chair conformation is more stable than boat conformation at room temperature.

<p>The boat conformation has unfavorable steric interactions between a pair of 14 hydrogens the so-called flagpole hydrogens that are. The boat conformation is quite flexible. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. Which is more stable chair or boat conformation. By contrast in the chair form of cyclohexane the Newman reveals that all of the hydrogens and carbons are staggered as you look along each C-C bond which is a considerably more stable conformation.

<p>The twist boat conformation has less steric and torsion strain as compared to half chair conformation and It is 55kcalmol less stable than the chair form. Usually if a certain geometry is less stable than another one it is not considered stable. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. Answer 1 of 2. Among which chair conformation is most stable because it has negligible ring strains so its potential energy is 0 kcalmol. Nomenclature Of Coordination Compounds Chemistry Compounds Names.</p>

<p>Although it is more stable the chair conformation is much more rigid than the boat conformation. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. However why chair is more stable than boat. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. However if there are more groups on the cyclohexane we need to take into consideration the 13-diaxial interaction of all.

<p>Boat and chair are the conformations of cyclohexane. Therefore the chair conformation is more stable than boat conformation at room temperature. By flexing to a new formthe twist conformation Fig5the boat conformation can relieve some of its torsional strain and at the same time reduce the flagpole interactions. However why chair is more stable than boat. This leads to a staggered conformation in chair form reducing torsional strain.
