<p><strong>Chair Conformation Cis Vs Trans</strong>, 2 methylcyclohexanol is an alcohol. There are two possibilities that are cis or trans but the position of the methyl group on axial or equatorial bond on cyclohexane determines whether the compound is cis or trans.

Contrary to open-chain alkenes cis cycloalkenes in general are more stable than their trans isomers. Cholesterol testosterone are trans- rigid dislike. Conformational Analysis of Disubstituted Cyclohexanes 14-dimethylcyclohexane. As a result trans-1-ethyl-2-methylcyclohexane has a more stable chair conformer than cis-1-ethyl-2-methylcyclohexane.
