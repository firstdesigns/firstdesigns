<p><strong>Chair Conformation Geometry</strong>, Although the hydrocarbon cyclohexane is typically drawn as if it were flat in reality the structure is not flat at all. However keep in mind that the geometry of the cyclohexane needs to be. An alternate conformation for a six-membered ring is called the boat.</p>

<p>Geometry vibration frequencies and IR absorption intensities of 6-radialene considering the planar and chair form. The CH2 bending frequencies. The tert-butyl group needs to be placed in the equatorial bond as it is the lowest energy or highest stability conformation.</p>
<h3 id="actually-these-bonds-are-a-bit-wobbly-too-enough-for-the-carbons-to-wobble-between-boat-and-chair-conformations-on-occasion">Actually these bonds are a bit wobbly too enough for the carbons to wobble between boat and chair conformations on occasion.</h3><p>NB that your cyclohexane might not initially be in this conformation if you are very unlucky and have somehow managed to arrange the atoms in such a manner that they are closer to one of the other conformations than the chair one and in that case we will have to rearrange them to our desired conformation. The chair conformation of cyclohexane is not rigid. I cant see how the structure drawn is the enantiomer. This conformation is called the chair because it looks sort of like a reclining lounge chair as shown here. In a chair conformation the bond angles for each carbon are about 109 degrees so the tetrahedrals are pretty close. To build the chair conformation.</p>

Lets get some practice drawing it chair confirmations one way to do it is to start by drawing two parallel lines that are offset from each others let me go ahead and show you what I mean so heres heres one line and then here is another line theyre parallel to each other but theyre offset a little bit next were going to draw two horizontal dotted lines so the top horizontal dotted line is going to be on level with that top. Actually these bonds are a bit wobbly too enough for the carbons to wobble between boat and chair conformations on occasion. All of the bond angles are close to tetrahedral but close contact between flagpole hydrogens causes van der Waals strain in boat.
