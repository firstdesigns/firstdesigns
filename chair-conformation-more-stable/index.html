<p>Why are chairs more stable than boats. Assuming that A values are additive and hence subtractive if necessary predict what the ΔG value will be. Always place the largesthighest priority group in the equatorial position. By drawing cyclohexane in a chair conformation we can see how the Hs are positioned. You just need to find the energy value for the axial group. A Values Of Axial Groups In The Cyclohexane Chair Conformation Advanced Organic Chemistry Chemistry Interactive.</p>

<p>You just need to find the energy value for the axial group. A chair conformation is one of many conformations of a cyclohexane ring and it is most stable. This is because a chair conformation would force one of the tert-butyl groups to an axial position. Chemistry questions and answers. For example cis-14-di-tert-butylcyclohexane prefers the boat confirmation. Pin On Alkene Reactions With Practice Problems.</p>
