<p>For example cis-14-di-tert-butylcyclohexane prefers the boat confirmation. Cyclohexane Chair Conformations Axial and Equatorial Stability. With this conformation the bond angles are 1109 degrees much closer to the ideal 1095 degrees.</p>
<h3 id="the-chair-conformation-is-estimated-to-be-lower-in-energy-than-the-twist-conformation-by-approximately-23-kj-mol--1">The chair conformation is estimated to be lower in energy than the twist conformation by approximately 23 kJ mol -1.</h3><p>This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. Cyclohexane and the natural bond angles of C C and C H add a great deal of flexibility to the ring. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. Draw the ring flip for each of the following chair conformations. If the tert-butyl group is placed in the axial bond then the chair has the highest energy or the least stable conformation. All the carbon-hydrogen bonds are also fully staggered eliminating the torsional strain.</p>

<p>The tert-butyl group needs to be placed in the equatorial bond as it is the lowest energy or highest stability conformation. Cyclohexane and the natural bond angles of C C and C H add a great deal of flexibility to the ring. Notice how the axial-methyl group is thrown closely together with the axial hydrogens in carbons 3 and 5. However if there are more groups on the cyclohexane we need to take into consideration the 13-diaxial interaction of all. This is because a chair conformation would force one of the tert-butyl groups to an axial position.

<p>In cyclohexane and most of its derivatives the chair conformation is more stable. The carbons in cyclohexane have sp3 hybridization and hence they tend to have an angle of 1095 degrees. So choosing the more stable chair conformation is straightforward when there is only one group on the cyclohexane. This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat.

However if there are more groups on the cyclohexane we need to take into consideration the 13-diaxial interaction of all. The chair conformation allows it to have the closest possible angle which would be 1109 degreesDue to this the strain reduces and results in a lowered energy. Least stable chair Most stable chair 1 1 1 Ð18 kcalmolG b Chlorocyclohexane also exists in two different chair conformations one of which is 06 kcalmol more stable than the other ie the A value for the chloro group is 06.

<p>So choosing the more stable chair conformation is straightforward when there is only one group on the cyclohexane. All the carbon-hydrogen bonds are also fully staggered eliminating the torsional strain. You just need to find the energy value for the axial group. In each of the two boxes below draw in a bond to one chloro Cl group in the appropriate position. As taught in this Tutorial Video.

<p>This organic chemistry video tutorial provides a basic introduction into drawing the chair conformation of cyclohexane and identifying the most stable confor. Draw the lowest energy chair conformation for each of the following cyclohexane structures. As taught in this Tutorial Video. Cyclohexane Ring Flips and Chair Stability. Of these two positions of the Hs the equitorial form will be the most stable because the hydrogen atoms or perhaps the.
