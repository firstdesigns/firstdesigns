<p>If your garage door is falling down when closing you should look to replace the springs. If its open and it wont close move onto the next step. On a properly functioning garage door there are springs in place to make the garage door close slowly instead of slamming down.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-can-it-is-best-to-disengage-the-sensors-when-the-garage-door-is-down">If you can it is best to disengage the sensors when the garage door is down.</h3><p>If the light is off the sensor itself is probably off and if the light is blinking it means something is getting in the way of the signal. Sometimes instead of just stopping the opener will attempt to raise the door before we have a chance to press the button to close it again. I had the same problem with my garage door in the morning the sun was shining directly at the sensor and the door could not close. If the garage door is open the door could fall when you switch to manual mode. Sometimes it takes me 5 minutes of coaxing to get it to come. Garage door wont close in the morning but closes at night just fine.</p>
