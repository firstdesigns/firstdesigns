<p>Sporotrichosis is also known as rose gardener’s disease. Sporotrichosis (also termed rose gardener�s or rose handler�s disease) is an infection caused by the fungus sporothrix schenckii, found throughout the world; The black spot fungus, if left untreated, can totally defoliate a rose bush, causing a weakening of the overall rose bush, thus high stress on the plant. Although not a disease or pest, chlorosis is a problem often faced by rose gardeners. If left unchecked, it can cause a rose bush to totally defoliate.
