<p>I resetted them but still no power. Either i have the wrong breaker or there is a hidden junction box somewhere behind the wall. No one likes a power outage. I changed all the outlets to gfci and checked again. I did test the voltage again it went up to 230v at the main garage board near main electric supply tested the switch and garage showing same voltage but still nothing is working in the garage.

<p>So I reset the breaker and went back to the garage. You say theres no power to a garage right. Are you sure that there is not a separate consumer unit somewhere with MCBs and RCDs just for the garage. If you have a multi meter check the circuit breaker for voltage even if it doesnt look tripped. 3 Answers Originally Posted by dumdum64 I went to replace an extension cord in the garage that supplied power to the garage door opener with a wire from the main panel to the opener in the garage.

<p>When I came from my absence I noticed there was no power at all in the garage. The garage has no power or water and it is probably not going to be realistically possible to run either to it. I resetted them but still no power. GFCI devices often protect the outlet circuit that is installed into the garage therefore if this device trips off then garage outlets will be affected. If this is unsuccessful there is damage to the system that must be repaired by a professional.
